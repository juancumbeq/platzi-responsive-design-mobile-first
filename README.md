## What did I learn through this course:
Welcome to this course on Adaptive Design, which means mobile-first design.

Why Design for Mobile?
Over 50% of traffic comes from devices like cell phones or tablets, as it's much more convenient to open a website from a mobile device than to open a laptop and search for it. This isn't just a trend; it's a standard we must work with.

What Will You Learn in This Course?
Some of the skills you will acquire include:

Analyzing the architecture of your project starting from a wireframe
Applying styles for each breakpoint
Evaluating the quality of your design with Lighthouse
And much more!

# INITIAL SETUP
  ## [Analyzing The Design: The Course Project]()
It is important to know that this course is the practical continuation of the Ultimate HTML and CSS Course.

<br>

  ### What do you need to work on your first project?
You will create a complete real project that adapts to different screen sizes. This will be a project you can add to your portfolio to showcase your skills in Web Development.

Here are some of the tools you need to use:

  - Figma: one of the most widely used software tools for building high-quality wireframes or prototypes is Figma.

Web projects are analyzed from the wireframes shared by the design team. Wireframes are prototypes that allow us to have a clear structure of what the real project will be, which we as developers will have to turn into code.

<br>

  ### Project
[The project you will build can be found here.](https://www.figma.com/proto/sMmlQaZldfDcLERYYWe6h4/Bata-Bit?node-id=44-594&scaling=scale-down)

</p>

It is a static landing page with a header, a footer, and four content sections. To see how it is designed, go to the tab above and select "Open in editor."

You will be able to see all the screens created by the design team, along with the color palette, buttons, fonts, images, etc. You can also see, by clicking on a section, the CSS code that Figma recommends. It is not about copying and pasting, but about reviewing the elements that compose it to use them in our code, such as the font, color, or sizes.
